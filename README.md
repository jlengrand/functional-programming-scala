# Functional Programming in Scala

This repo contains code written while going through [Functional Programming in Scala](https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-scala).

Everything might not be correct, as I try to do everything on my own. If you want the real answers, I suggest you go look into [the official repository](https://github.com/fpinscala/fpinscala) instead.
